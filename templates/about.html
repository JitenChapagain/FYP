Every member of JASA is committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity, compassion, and service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began with a simple question: How can we ensure that no life is lost due to a lack of blood? Driven by this purpose, we've harnessed the latest technologies, fostered partnerships with hospitals and organizations, and engaged with communities across Nepal. Each project we undertake is guided by our core values—innovation, transparency, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          At JASA, we celebrate diversity and inclusion, recognizing that our strength lies in the unique perspectives and talents of our team members. We are proud of our achievements, but even prouder of the lives we touch and the hope we inspire. Together, we are not just building software; we are building a movement for a healthier, more connected Nepal.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Thank you for supporting JASA and RaktaSewa. We invite you to join us on this journey—whether as a donor, volunteer, partner, or advocate. Together, we can make a difference, one drop at a time.
